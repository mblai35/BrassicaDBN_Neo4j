title: "Importing DBNs to Neo4j"

I began by creating a folder named DBNdb. By choosing this folder as my database location for Neo4j, it was initialized as a database. I created an import folder within DBNdb and moved desired csv's for importation into the folder. 

Importing GRENITS results into Neo4j:

```{Cypher}

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///prob_above08.csv' AS line
MERGE (a:Gene {name:line.From})
MERGE (b:Gene {name:line.To})
MERGE (a)-[:RELATED_TO {method: "GRENITS", Prob: TOINT( line.Probability), Strength: TOINT(line.Strength)}]->(b);

```

Importing simone results into Neo4j:

```{r}

defaulNet1 <- read.csv(file.choose(), row.names = 1)
defaulNet1Theta <- read.csv(file.choose(), row.names = 1)

```

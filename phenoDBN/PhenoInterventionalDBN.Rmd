In order use interventionalDBN, we will need to manipulate the data to get it into the correct format. 
```{r}
# Load necessary packages. 
library(data.table)
library(interventionalDBN)

# Import data. 
Pheno <- read.csv(file = "/Users/mblai/Documents/PhenoBrassicaImp.csv")

# Convert to data.table for easy averaging. 
Pheno <- as.data.table(Pheno)

# Average phenotype values across replicates. 
avgPheno <- Pheno[, .(Photo = mean(Photo), gs = mean(gs), 
             FvFm = mean(Fv.Fm.), Starch = mean(Starch),
             NSC = mean(NSC), SM = mean(SM...)), 
         by = .(Timepoint, Treatment)]

# Order by Treatment. 
avgPheno <- avgPheno[order(Treatment),]

# Create data.frame in appropriate format: Cell.line, Inhibitor, 
# Stimuli, Timepoint, and expression values. 
phenoNet <- data.frame(Cell.line = rep(1, 24), 
                       Inhibitor = avgPheno$Treatment, 
                       Stimuli = rep("WW", 24), 
                       Timepoint = avgPheno$Timepoint, 
                       avgPheno[, 3:8])

# Definite baseline as WW and inhibited as Dry.
droughtEffects <- interventionEffects(phenoNet, 1, "WW", "Dry")

# Update phenoNet to the correct format using the interventionalDBN
# formatData function. 
phenoNet <- formatData(phenoNet)

# Create an empty n by P (# of obs by # of cols of expression data) 
# Z matrix.
Z <- matrix(0, 24, 6)

```

```{r}

# Perform inference for DBN.
pNetwork <- interventionalInference(phenoNet$y, phenoNet$X0, 
                                    phenoNet$X1, Z, max.indeg = 3,
                                     perfectOut = T, fixedEffectOut = T)

```

**The purpose of this file is to provide thorough documentation of the 
actions performed by the author, Mallory Lai, during the course of importing
Brassica data into Neo4j.**  


Neo4j Community Edition 3.0.4  
R Versions will be listed within each .R file. 


> 7/7/16  

* Received data from Carmela 'Lina' Guadagno. Excel data files refer to single 
time course experiment in Dec. 2013 on R500 Brassica rapa plants. Files consist
of a summary of desired physiological traits and single IRGA's outputs. 


> 8/18/16 

* Downloaded data to local computer's Documents folder  
* Converted .xls files to .csv and placed in file folder "Time_series_data_csv"
* Replaced the spaces in titles with underscores.   
eg. 4Mall_Dried Biomass_dec 2013 to 4Mall_Dried_Biomass_dec_2013
* Also removed underscores from the ends of file names  
eg. PhysTimeCourse_12132013_ to PhysTimeCourse_12132013
* an "import" folder was created within Neo4j's default data
* TO DO (M.Lai): Data files should be consistent:
    + File '4Mall_Dried_Biomass_dec_2013.csv' uses "W" and "D" for treatment
    conditions whereas other files use "WW" (for "well-watered") and "Dry."
    Change "W's" and "D's" were to be consistent with the other files. The
    "Line" column should also be changed to R500 for consistency.
